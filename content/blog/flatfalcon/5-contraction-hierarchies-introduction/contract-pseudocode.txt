# Input: Graph G = (V, E), node v to contract
# Output: Modified G with shortcuts added and v removed

for each neighbor u of v:
    for each neighbor w of v:
        if (u != w) and ((u, w) not in E or t(u, w) > t(u, v) + t(v, w)):
            add shortcut edge (u, w) with weight t(u, v) + t(v, w)

remove node v and all its incident edges
