# Theme Implementation Summary

## What was added:

### 1. Theme Context (`app/context/ThemeContext.tsx`)
- Clean, simple theme state management
- Automatically detects system preference on first visit
- Persists user choice in localStorage
- Prevents theme flashing during SSR

### 2. Theme Toggle (`app/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
- Uses Tabler icons (IconSun, IconMoon) from your existing dependencies
- Fixed position in top-right corner
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### 3. Updated Files:
- **`app/layout.tsx`**: Wrapped with ThemeProvider
- **`app/page.tsx`**: Added ThemeToggle component and improved styling
- **`app/globals.css`**: Added custom scrollbar styling for desktop

## How to use:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Click the sun/moon icon in the top-right corner to toggle themes

3. Your preference is automatically saved and restored on future visits

## Key Features:
- ✅ Clean code using existing Tabler icons
- ✅ Respects system preference
- ✅ Smooth transitions
- ✅ No theme flashing
- ✅ Minimal CSS (removed aggressive transitions)
- ✅ TypeScript support

## Customization:
- Modify dark mode colors in your Tailwind classes (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-900`)
- Change toggle button position by editing the classes in `ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Add more theme-aware styles using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix
